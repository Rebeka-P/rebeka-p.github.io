<h2>How Long Did It Take for Schools to Adopt Their Fight Songs?</h2>
How to read the dumbbell timeline plot:

<ul>
<li>left circle: university founding year</li>
<li>right football: fight song’s composition year</li>
<li>connecting line between the two points: time between founding and fight song (longer line meand the school took longer to adopt a fight song)</li>
<li>brown solid vertical line: the overall average midpoint between founding year and song year across all 60 schools in the dataset (with known fight song years)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall Description</h3>
There are 6 timeline plots graphed as a dumbbell plot with their foundation year and the year their fight song was written, and a line connecting the two. Each plot is grouped by school conference: ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Independent, PAC-12, and SEC. Each graph has a y-axis with a list of colleges for the respective conference. The x-axis for each graph are the years from 1750 to 2000 in increments of 50. The overall average midpoint between a college's foundation year and the year their fight song was written is shown on every graph as a vertical line a little before the year 1900.

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>The right-hand footballs cluster heavily in the 1900–1950 window, regardless of when a school was founded.</p>

<p> Older schools (founded in the late 1700s or early–mid 1800s) have a longer time between founding and the year the fight song was written. Newer schools founded nearer to 1900 have much shorter time differences. A quick glance reveals that individual midpoint between foundation and fight song year for schools founded earlier is typically to the left of the overall average midpoint. Similarly, the individual midpoint between foundation and fight song years for schools founded later is typically to the right of the overall average midpoint.</p>

<p>ACC, Big Ten, and SEC have schools with the oldest founded years, but have fight song years in the early 1900s. The time between foundation and the fight song are the longest for Big Ten and SEC conferences. For schools in the ACC, however, the time between the foundation and fight song year is generally shorter than the Big Ten and SEC schools.</p></p>


<p>Big 12 and PAC-12 have schools with founding dates in the late 1800s to early 1900s. The fight songs are in the early 1900s, so the time between the foundation and the fight song are shorter on average.</p>





<h2>Tracking BPM, Length, and Lyrical Tropes in Fight Songs from 1893–1968</h2>
<p>How to read the timeline bubble plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>outer circle: song beats per minute</li>
<li>middle circle: song duration in seconds</li>
<li>inner circle: song number of tropes (recurring theme, i.e., "fight", "win", nonsense words)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each dot represents a song between 1893 and 1968. The bigger and darker the dot is, the higher the value. The density of dots by angle reflects how many fight songs were composed in that period. The same scale is used for all three circles.</p>

The timeline is a circular bubble plot with three rings. The outer ring is labeled "beats per minute", the middle ring is labeled "duration", and the inner ring is labeled "#(number) tropes". The timeline starts at the year 1893 and ends at the year 1968. A rectangle surrounds a dot on each of the circles on the same angle, and is labeled "1898, University of Michigan, 83 bpm, 122 seconds, 0 tropes". This is to emphasize that each dot represents one school.

Below is the data table, ordered by increasing years. The school name is unimportant, so they were not included.

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>Dot density (number of songs) is largest between the 1900s to the 1930s. In the 1900s and 1910s, the songs have higher bpm and lower second duration. After 1930, bpm decreases a little overall and the second duration increases a little overall. The 1920s and beyond seemed to have a more consistent song duration compared to the years before the 1920s, where there appears to be a variety of durations. The 1930s decade seems to have the highest bpm and shortest duration. Early songs (1890s to early 1900s) and later songs (late 1940s to late 1960s) seem to have the most variation in bpm, duration, and tropes.</p>
